## 🔍 Issues Identified

### **POST /api/Project Endpoint**
- **Issue:** Consistent 500 Internal Server Error
- **Authorization:** ✅ Working (CompanyAdmin → Manager policy)
- **Validation:** ✅ Payload validation passes
- **Suspected Causes:**

1. Enable detailed server-side logging
2. Check ProjectCode auto-generation logic
3. Verify foreign key constraints (ClientId, ManagerId)
4. Test with different manager IDs
5. Review project creation service implementation
