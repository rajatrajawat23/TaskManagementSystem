# Task Management System - Fixed Issues Summary

## Date: December 19, 2025

### ✅ Issues Fixed and Actions Taken:

1. **Docker Desktop Not Running**
   - **Issue**: Docker daemon was not running
   - **Fix**: Started Docker Desktop using `open -a Docker`
   - **Result**: Docker is now running successfully

2. **SQL Server Container**
   - **Issue**: Needed to verify SQL Server container status
   - **Fix**: Container was already running on port 1433
   - **Container**: taskmanagement-sqlserver (healthy)

3. **Database Connection String**
   - **Issue**: appsettings.json had incorrect database password
   - **Old**: `Password=YourStrongPassword`
   - **Fixed**: `Password=SecureTask2025#@!`
   - **Result**: Database connection successful ✅

4. **JWT Security Configuration**
   - **Issue**: Weak JWT secret key
   - **Old**: `YourSecretKeyMustBeAtLeast32CharactersLongForProperSecurity`
   - **Fixed**: `SuperSecureJWTKey2025TaskMgmt789ComplexTokenForAuthentication`
   - **Result**: More secure JWT configuration

5. **Port Conflict**
   - **Issue**: Port 5175 was already in use by another instance
   - **Fix**: Killed the old process (PID 945) and restarted
   - **Result**: Application now running successfully

### 🚀 Current Status:

- **Application URL**: http://localhost:5175
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:5175 (accessible in browser)
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:5175/health - Returns "Healthy" ✅
- **Database**: Connected and queries executing successfully
- **Background Services**: Email Notification Service started
- **Process**: Running in screen session named 'taskapi'

### 📊 Key Success Indicators:

1. ✅ Database connection established
2. ✅ All Entity Framework queries executing
3. ✅ No startup errors
4. ✅ Health endpoint responding
5. ✅ Application accessible on localhost:5175
6. ✅ Swagger documentation available

### 🔧 Technical Details:

- **Framework**: .NET 9.0
- **Database**: SQL Server 2022 (in Docker)
- **Port**: 5175
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI

### 📝 Notes:

- The application has some EF Core warnings about global query filters, but these don't affect functionality
- The Email Notification Service is running but will show cancellation errors on shutdown (normal behavior)
- All API endpoints are ready for testing via Swagger UI

### 🎯 Next Steps:

1. Access Swagger UI at http://localhost:5175
2. Test API endpoints
3. Create initial data using the API
4. Monitor logs in the screen session if needed

The backend is now fully operational and ready for use! 🎉
